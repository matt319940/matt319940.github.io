				<strong>Matt Kelly</strong> is a Business Operations Lead at Park Place Technologies, LLC. He is an experienced leader, creative thinker, and logical egghead. He attended the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), receiving his bachelors in Strategic Management, during which time he joined the military, serving 6 years in the Army Reserves as a Human Resource Sergeant. The highlight of his military career was working at the reservist Head Quarters in Arlington Heights, Illinois where he lead a team of 4-5 specialists in accomplishing administrative and HR tasks while working directly with One-Star Generals.
				<br><br>After graduating from UIC, Matt moved out to Cleveland where he started his career as a Contracts Administrator at Park Place Tech. After only a year, he worked his way up to Business Operations Leadership - overseeing a team of 16 individuals, responsible for training, and being the liaison between our Legal and Financial departments for our customers and sales staff.
				<br><br>In August of 2019, this hard-working twenty-six-year-old decided to further push himself, dedicating his remaining time towards self-improvement by attending Case Western Reserve University's Coding Bootcamp where he learned Full Stack Development.
				<br><br>His coding experience includes HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Express.js, React.js, Java, Node.js, Database Theory, Bookshelf.js, MongoDB, MySQL, Command Line, Git, and more.
				<br><br>Outside of work, Matt is a coding hobbyist, reads books, and plays video games, but most importantly, Matt loves spending time with his wife and two dogs. The most important thing to him is supporting his small family, which is why he is so dedicated to maintaining the highest quality of work attainable. </p>
